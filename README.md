# face_recognition_own
This is my repository to implementing face recognition course using face_recognition library. It's absolutely easy to understand, and it's fast, powerful and very accurate. So, feel free to use it up to you. 
Drop your image on Google Colaboratory, and make a little change with path. 
And then run it!
